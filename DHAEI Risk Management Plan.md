## Executive Summary {#executive-summary}

This Risk Management Plan outlines the key risks, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies for DHA Enterprise Inc. (DHAEI), a software development company with a main office in Oshawa, Ontario, several branch offices, and remote employees. The plan was developed to align with ISO/IEC 27001 standards and addresses the organization’s need to protect its information assets while meeting technical, security, and user requirements.

Overview of Risk Assessment
The risk assessment process identified critical assets, threats, and vulnerabilities across DHAEI's infrastructure. Three primary risks were highlighted:

1. Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data
   * Threat: Cyberattacks exploiting weak authentication mechanisms.
   * Vulnerability: Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and inconsistent access control policies.
2. Data Loss Due to System Failures
   * Threat: Hardware failures or natural disasters affecting servers.
   * Vulnerability: Limited redundancy in branch office servers and insufficient backup policies.
3. Phishing Attacks Targeting Employees
   * Threat: Social engineering attacks compromising user credentials.
   * Vulnerability: Lack of employee awareness training on identifying phishing attempts.

Each risk was analyzed for its potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information assets, as well as its likelihood of occurrence. Risks were prioritized based on their scores to focus on the most critical issues.

Key Findings

* The highest-priority risk is phishing attacks, which pose a significant threat to confidentiality due to the potential for compromised credentials leading to data breaches.
* Unauthorized access risks are also high-priority due to their impact on both confidentiality and integrity.
* Data loss risks are medium-priority, as existing backups provide partial mitigation; however, improvements in redundancy are necessary for long-term resilience.

These findings highlight three critical risks that require immediate attention based on their likelihood and impact scores (IT Governance, 2024).

Recommended Risk Treatments
To address these risks, the following mitigations are proposed:

1. Unauthorized Access:
   * Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all systems.
   * Enforce strong password policies and conduct regular access reviews.
   * Priority: High
2. Data Loss:
   * Deploy automated backup solutions and implement server redundancy at branch offices.
   * Establish disaster recovery protocols to ensure business continuity.
   * Priority: Medium
3. Phishing Attacks:
   * Conduct regular employee training sessions on recognizing phishing emails.
   * Deploy advanced email filtering tools to detect and block malicious messages.
   * Priority: High

Next Steps
The implementation of these treatments will require collaboration across DHAEI’s management team, IT security personnel, and branch office technicians. Regular monitoring of risks and periodic reviews of the Risk Management Plan will ensure that DHAEI remains resilient against emerging threats while supporting its planned expansion into Brampton, Mississauga.

## Purpose {#purpose}

To systematically identify, assess, and address risks that could impact DHA Enterprise Inc. (DHAEI) in achieving its business objectives, particularly in maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of its information assets. This plan aims to minimize potential damages caused by security incidents through the application of effective risk treatment strategies while ensuring compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 standards (Sprinto, 2024; IT Governance, 2024).

This document will guide DHAEI in safeguarding its infrastructure, including its main office in Oshawa, Ontario, branch offices, and remote operations. It will also address risks associated with planned changes, such as the establishment of a new branch office in Brampton, Mississauga. By identifying vulnerabilities and threats across DHAEI's digital and physical environments, this plan will enable the organization to implement prioritized controls and ensure continuity of operations.

The Risk Management Plan will serve as a foundation for informed decision-making by DHAEI's management team and technical staff. It will also provide a clear framework for addressing risks associated with existing systems (e.g., Active Directory domain, VPN connections, file servers) and meeting technical, security, and user requirements. This version aligns with the assignment's requirements and incorporates details specific to DHAEI's context.

## Risk Assessment {#risk-assessment}

### Process {#process}

The risk assessment process for DHA Enterprise Inc. (DHAEI) will follow a systematic approach to identify, evaluate, and prioritize risks to its information assets.

### Assets, Vulnerabilities, and Threats {#assets-vulnerabilities-and-threats}

Based on DHAEI's environment, the following are three main threats the organization faces:

1. Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:
   * Vulnerability: Weak password policies or lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
   * Threat: Cyberattacks targeting user credentials or exploiting unprotected systems.
2. Data Loss Due to System Failures:
   * Vulnerability: Lack of redundancy in branch office servers or inadequate backup processes.
   * Threat: Hardware failures or natural disasters impacting data availability.
3. Phishing Attacks on Employees:
   * Vulnerability: Lack of employee awareness or training on recognizing phishing emails.

Challenges in managing these threats include ensuring consistent security practices across branch offices, addressing technical limitations in remote environments, and maintaining employee compliance with security policies.

### Risk Owners {#risk-owners}

For each identified risk, a "chain" of ownership from ground-level personnel to senior executives will be established:

1. Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:
   * Ground Level: IT Security Technicians—Monitor access logs and enforce password policies.
   * Mid Level: Paul Alexander (CISO)—Oversees implementation of MFA and system hardening.
   * Senior Level: Amanda Wilson (CIO)—Approves resource allocation for security enhancements.
2. Data Loss Due to System Failures:
   * Ground Level: Branch Office Support Technicians—Ensure proper server maintenance.
   * Mid Level: IT Security Team—Implement backup solutions and redundancy measures.
   * Senior Level: Amanda Wilson (CIO)—Approves funding for infrastructure upgrades.
3. Phishing Attacks on Employees:
   * Ground Level: Employees—Participate in security awareness training.
   * Mid Level: Paul Alexander (CISO)—Develops training programs and monitors incidents.
   * Senior Level: Alan Hake (CEO)—Promotes a culture of security awareness across the organization.

### Impact and Likelihood {#impact-and-likelihood}

Risks are evaluated using a matrix that considers both likelihood and impact to prioritize treatment options effectively (Secureframe, n.d.)

| Threat | Impact on CIA | Impact Rating (0–10) | Likelihood Rating (0–5) | Risk Score (= Impact × Likelihood) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Unauthorized Access** | C, I | 8 | 4 | 32 |
| **Data Loss Due to System Failures** | A | 9 | 3 | 27 |
| **Phishing Attacks** | C | 7 | 5 | 35 |

### Risk acceptance criteria {#risk-acceptance-criteria}

The highest-risk item identified is Phishing Attacks, with a risk score of 35. This poses a significant threat to confidentiality due to potential data breaches caused by compromised credentials. This risk must be prioritized for immediate mitigation through employee training and technical controls like email filtering. Risks with low likelihood and minimal impact may be accepted if they fall within DHAEI's risk tolerance levels (Sprinto, 2024).

## Risk Treatment {#risk-treatment}

These are the recommended mitigations for the three main threats identified above:

| Threat | Recommended Mitigation | Priority | Justification |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Unauthorized Access** | Implement MFA, enforce strong password policies, conduct regular access reviews(Sprinto, 2024; Secureframe, n.d.). | High | Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive systems, reducing exposure to cyberattacks. |
| **Data Loss Due to System Failures** | Deploy automated backups, implement server redundancy at branch offices. | Medium | Ensures availability of critical data even in case of hardware failures or disasters. |
| **Phishing Attacks** | Conduct regular employee training sessions; deploy advanced email filtering tools. | High | Reduces likelihood of successful phishing attacks by improving user awareness. |

### Prioritization Justification

1. Phishing attacks are prioritized as high due to their high likelihood and potential impact on confidentiality.
2. Unauthorized access is also a high priority as it directly threatens both confidentiality and integrity.
3. Data loss is medium priority because existing backups provide partial mitigation. However, redundancy improvements are necessary for long-term resilience.
